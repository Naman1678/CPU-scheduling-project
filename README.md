Description of the programming project:
The project is given to introduce to CPU scheduling techniques.
The input consists of pairs of numbers that are indicating the REAL TIME and INTERACTIVE processes along with the time in ms. The code simulates the execution of real-time and interactive processes, including CPU, TTY, and disk processes. It enqueues processes based on their class (REAL-TIME or INTERACTIVE) and their resource requests 

Instructions for running the code:

1. Download the input and code file.
2. There was some issue this C code in VScode or CLion compile, so I wrote the code on online GDB compiler.
3. Open the online GDB compiler using the given link : https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler
4. Copy and paste the entire code over there.
5. Press Ctrl+M or click on the new file button in the top left corner of the page.
5. Type the name for new file as (input.txt)
6. Copy the input file and paste it on the new file in online GDB.
7. Run the program.

*NOTE: THIS PROGRAM IS ONLY RUNNING ON ONLINE GDB COMPILER, SO I AM REQUESTING YOU TO PLEASE RUN IT OVER THERE, DUE TO SOME ISSUE.*


OUTPUT:
1. On running the program it should show the Interactive simulated time(in ms).
2. It should also provide a summary about the number of real time processes completed, total number of interactive processes and how much time the CPU and the disk was busy.
